This site is made with [Eleventy]({{ tools.11ty }}) and hosted at [Netlify]({{ tools.netlify }}). This site would not have been possible without the [Learn Eleventy from Scratch](https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/) course at [Piccalilli]({{ tools.piccalilli }}). This site also uses a slightly modified version of [Andy Bell's Modern Reset](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/modern-css-reset).

Fonts used [Shrikhand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Shrikhand) for the site title and [Bitter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter) for the body.

Icons are [Tabler Icons](https://tablericons.com/).

Handwritten CSS.

Other resources that helped me figure out something used on this site can be found in the inaugural and unimaginatively named [Finally, a new site](/articles/finally-a-new-site/#thank-you-one-and-all) article.
