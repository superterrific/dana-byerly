My approach to saving links about dev and design is all over the place. I have some saved in my RSS reader of choice ([Feedly]({{ tools.feedly }})), I have a collection of links in [Notion]({{ tools.notion }}) and another older collection in [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/). I also have a couple of collections in [Standard Notes]({{ tools.standardNotes }}).

One morning as I scanned my various Monday morning newsletters looking for articles I wanted to read later, I had my usual thought of "I wonder if I would use Pinboard more if it was responsive?". Followed quickly by "I'll just start throwing links in [Airtable]({{ tools.airtable }}) and then figure out what to do with them". Followed quickly by mocking up a little prototype using [Vue]({{ tools.vue }}).

A week later I had completed this project and am happy to report that it's been useful and easy to maintain. In fact a couple of things I saved were helpful in building out this site!

I put together an [extensive write up at Notion](https://www.notion.so/superterrific/Pile-of-hrefs-Project-80f1667163bd41a2ac69fb3c1b4326e7) that includes a problem statement, use cases, detailed information about implementation and design as well as an overview of how I administer the site.  At some point I might move it over here.
