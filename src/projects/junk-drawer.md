[Dana Byerly's Digital Junk Drawer](https://danabyerly-junkdrawer.website/), or the Junk Drawer as it's affectionately referred to, is my catch-all site.

The site is built with [Eleventy]({{ tools.11ty }}) and uses WordPress as a headless content management system. I wrote a two post series on the process...

* [WordPress & Eleventy Part One: WordPress](/articles/wordpress-and-eleventy-part-one-wordpress/) - Some considerations for setting up WordPress to use with Eleventy.
* [WordPress & Eleventy Part Two](/articles/wordpress-and-eleventy-part-two-eleventy/): Eleventy - Some considerations for using WordPress as a headless content management system for Eleventy.

Data for [TV Blurbs](https://danabyerly-junkdrawer.website/tv-blurbs/) and [Wake Up Songs](https://danabyerly-junkdrawer.website/wake-up-songs/) are pulled in from [Airtable]({{ tools.airtable }}) and the lastest [Pixelfed]({{ author.pixelfedUrl }}) image is pulled in via RSS.

In its current form it's mostly a blog, but also a place to collect various non-blog thoughts and ephemera. It's not quite a digital garden, at least in the way that most people create and tend to their digital gardens. It's an archive, at least aspirationally.

At some point I may collect my thoughts on the Junk Drawer on this page, but in the meantime I've already written about a bit about it. At this site I touched on [why I started it](/notes/behold-the-junk-drawer/) and discussed [some recent updates](/notes/junk-drawer-updates/). I also wrote a bit more about the new features [at the Junk Drawer](https://danabyerly-junkdrawer.website/blog/new-junk-in-the-drawer/).
