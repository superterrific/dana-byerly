[Dana Byerly's Digital Junk Drawer](https://danabyerly-junkdrawer.website/), or the Junk Drawer as it's affectionately referred to, is my catch-all site. 

In its current form it's mostly a blog, but also a place to collect various non-blog thoughts and ephemera. It's not quite a digital garden, at least in the way that most people create and tend to their digital gardens. It's an archive, at least aspirationally.

At some point I may collect my thoughts on the Junk Drawer on this page, but in the meantime I've already written about a bit about it. At this site I touched on [why I started it](/notes/behold-the-junk-drawer/) and discussed [some recent updates](/notes/junk-drawer-updates/). I also wrote a bit more about the new features [at the Junk Drawer](https://danabyerly-junkdrawer.website/blog/new-junk-in-the-drawer/).
