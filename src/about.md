I'm an interaction designer and [front of the front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/) developer. I'm keenly interested in modular design, accessibility, usability, performance and the open web.

I've been employed doing some form of web-based design since 1996, and for the last two decades have been working in the enterprise space.

## Highlights include
* Designing complex end-to-end enterprise systems
* Designing micro-interactions, including copy
* Mentoring designers and developers on the importance and practical application of accessibility
* Mentoring designers to better understand CSS, coding in general, and the use of DevTools in troubleshooting design
* Always explaining design decisions, other options considered and trade-offs
* Rapid prototyping to share early and often
* Creating and maintaining best practices and standards for accessibility, front-end development and UI patterns and interactions

I design in the browser and think prototyping is best way to elicit feedback, answer questions and make design decisions. I write modern vanilla CSS and follow the [principles of CUBE CSS ](https://cube.fyi/principles.html). I also love making websites!

This site is focused on my [side projects](/projects) and whatever I'm learning at the moment. I'm in the process of planning a new site for freelancing, hopefully by the end of of 2022. Recently I started [a new blog](https://danabyerly-junkdrawer.website/).

I don't currently have a portfolio, but if you're interested you can view my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danabyerly/), which admittedly could use an update.

If you think I can be of help with a project or you're looking to hire someone with my skills, don't hesitate [to get in touch](/contact/)!
