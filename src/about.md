I'm an interaction designer and [front of the front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/) developer. I do UX Things by day. I'm keenly interested in modular design, accessibility, usability, performance and the open web.

I've been employed doing some form of web-based design since 1996, and for the last two decades have been working in the enterprise space.

## Highlights include
* Designing complex end-to-end enterprise workflow systems
* Designing interactions, including copy
* Mentoring designers and developers on the importance and practical application of accessibility
* Mentoring designers to better understand CSS, coding in general, and the use of DevTools in troubleshooting design
* Always explaining design decisions, other options considered and trade-offs
* Rapid prototyping to share early and often
* Prototyping with HTML and CSS 
* Performing code reviews that also address design
* Creating and maintaining best practices and standards for UI patterns and accessibility
* Co-creating front-end development training for fullstack developers

I design in the browser and think prototyping is best way to elicit feedback, answer questions and make design decisions. I write modern vanilla CSS and follow the [principles of CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/principles.html). I also love making websites, especially with [Eleventy]({{ tools.11ty }})!

This site is focused on my [side projects](/projects) and whatever I'm learning at the moment. I also  [have a blog](https://danabyerly-junkdrawer.website/).

I don't currently have a portfolio, but if you're interested you can view my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danabyerly/), which admittedly could use an update.

If you think I can be of help with a project, or you're looking to hire someone with my skills, don't hesitate [to get in touch](/contact/)!
