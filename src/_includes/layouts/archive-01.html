          <mark>TL;DR</mark> <span class="visually-hidden">&mdash;</span> I'm a UI and interaction designer, and I'm going to be making this site better with progressive enhancements and improved organization. I like horse racing, photograhy and other lifelong learning opportunites, including trying to keep my skills up to date.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p><mark>Slightly expanded version:</mark> <span class="visually-hidden">&mdash;</span> I'm a UI and interaction designer who can code enough to build my own projects and communicate/collaborate well with engineers. I've been employed doing some variety of web-based design since 1996. I've worked in a wide variety of industries including television, network news, finance and healthcare. See <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danabyerly/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">my LinkedIn profile</a> for more information.</p>

        <p>The beginning of my career was primarily editorial and content design. For the last 15 years I've been working in the enterprise space, which is great for hard interaction design problems, and not so great for keeping one's front-end dev skills up to date as a matter of course.</p>

        <p>Until I figure out how to best put together a decent representation of my work, I've listed of some of my side projects and other fun(?) things I've done in the recent past. I've been slowly leveling up my front-end skills, especially with the more recent projects, which has been very enjoyable (and a never-ending source of "Oh wow, I have to go fix that now").</p>

        <p>At some point I might add a <a href="https://weeknot.es/what-on-earth-are-weeknotes-a81874c5cef9" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Week(ish) Notes</a> feature to track some of things I'm working on. Once I have a more robust version of this site built out, perhaps using <a href="https://sergey.cool/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sergey</a>, I will go into more detail on the bigger projects. Spoiler alert: I'm really into horse racing.</p>

        <h3 class="article-title"><a href="http://replaygenerator.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Random Replay Generator</a></h3>
        <p>My most recent and ambitious project! I came up with this idea about four years ago but didn't have the chops to build it. Enter Airtable and enough Vue skills cobbled together via search engine and the <a href="http://replaygenerator.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Random Replay Generator</a> was finally born. If you're looking for an easy way to binge-watch Thoroughbred racing replays, you might like this site. In <time datetime="2020-02">February 2020</time> I gave this site a little update, moving away from Bootstrap and coding the CSS myself. Other improvements include a dark mode for thos who have their OS set to dark mode, and an explicit non-javascript experience. <a href="https://twitter.com/superterrific/status/1223416466965508098"  rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Details in this thread</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="article-title"><a href="http://horseracingdatasets.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Horse Racing Datasets</a></h3>
        <p>Usable data is bizarrely hard to come by in American Thoroughred horse racing, so I created a way to share datasets that people had put together. This site started as a flat site that I later migrated to <a href="https://aritable.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Airtable</a>/<a href="https://vuejs.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vue</a>. On July 9, 2019 I launched a redesiged version. The main upgrade was adding the ability to view datasets by category or type, whereas initially it was all one big page. I'll talk more about the process and implementation when I expand this site beyond one big page, but the quickie version is: Designed in browser from the get using <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a> and uses a combo of <a href="https://vuejs.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vue</a> and <a href="https://sergey.cool/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sergey SSG</a>. Originally I thought I would use Vue routing, but I couldn't get it to work how I envisioned, and using a simple static site generator did exactly what I wanted with very low overhead. More on all this later!</p>

        <p>When friend and fellow horseplayer <a href="http://twitter.com/AdamWiener" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Adam Wiener</a> and I started this project in 2008, there was not an easy way to learn about Thoroughbred horse racing online. My role was everything on the creative and implementation side from concept to execution. This included design, dev (don't look at the code, unless you'd like to get a good picutre of my pre-leveling up period hackish CSS chops), Wordpress admin and editorial (both as an editor and writer). Basically I'm everything from Creative and Editorial Director to production assistant.</p>

        <p>I'm not good at data visualizations, but that didn't stop me from creating a few! I think this is the most most effective one I've created. I used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">sankey diagram</a> to illustrate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">graded stakes</a> prep race path of Kentucky Derby winners in their 3-year-old year. Since many winners also prepped in a mix of graded and non-graded races, I also created illustrations of each winner's full path. </p>

        <p>These are pretty vanilla as far as data visualizations go, but I wanted to see if there was a way to make it easier to answer simple questions about what has produced winners of an indivdual race over the last almost 30 years (the time period for which there is usable data). I think the is "For the most part, yes".</p>
