  "intro": "I'm Dana Byerly, a boring designer with a focus on keeping things simple. I enjoy coding and I design in the browser. I've worked on the web since 1996. For the past 16 years I've worked in the enterprise space. It's been awhile since I've had a proper web presence beyond my <a href=\"/projects/\">side projects,</a>  and the apparent \"return of the personal site\" seemed like as good a time as any."
