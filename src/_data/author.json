  "intro": "I'm Dana Byerly, a boring designer with a focus on keeping things simple. I make things in browsers with my favorite framework, HTML and CSS. I've worked on the web since 1996 and like to tinker with my various side projects. This site is where I write about my projects, the things I'm currently working on or learning."
