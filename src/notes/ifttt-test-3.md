The third attempt failed. I'm going to try one more time.

Adding another paragraph to see if/how formatting works.

Actually let me add a bunch of text to see how it handles truncation. I just got back from a dog walk. It was sunny and a little cool. We only ran into one other dog and Frieda barked enough that we crossed the street. Sometimes she doesn't react that much to other dogs, but sometimes she does. There's no zoning out when walking a reactive dog.
