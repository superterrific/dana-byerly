After [writing about](/articles/time-is-on-your-side/) ```<time>``` a few days ago I remembered that [Sara Soueidan has a nice post](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/horizontal-rules/) on ```<hr>```. This made me wonder how many other "Dear HTML Element" love letters there were out there.

I only spent a couple of hours looking, so I'm sure this is nowhere close to complete, but here are a few that I found.

* [Accessibility of the section element - Scott O'Hara](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2021/07/16/section.html)
* [HTML inputs and labels: A love story - Amber Wilson via CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/html-inputs-and-labels-a-love-story/)
* [Not your typical horizontal rules - Sara Soueidan](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/horizontal-rules/)
* [On the dl - Ben Meyers](https://benmyers.dev/blog/on-the-dl/)
* [ol vs. ul vs. dl - HTML Hell](https://www.htmhell.dev/tips/ol-vs-ul-vs-div/)
* [The section element - HTML Hell](https://www.htmhell.dev/tips/the-section-element/)
* [The track element - HTML Hell](https://www.htmhell.dev/tips/the-track-element/)
* [Use the "i" appropriately - Jens Oliver Meiert](https://meiert.com/en/blog/use-i-appropriately/)
* [What are H tags? - Bureau of Internet Accessibility](https://www.boia.org/blog/what-are-h-tags-how-headings-affect-user-experience)

There's also a [150 days of HTML Substack](https://150daysofhtml.substack.com/archive) with plenty of love letters to individual elements. Too many to list here!

I found many of these in the [Webdev newsletter](https://www.d.umn.edu/itss/training/online/webdesign/webdev_listserv.html). If you're not familiar I wrote a bit of a love letter to it [in a previous post](/notes/quick-fix-and-a-test/).

Am I missing a good post on a HTML element? [Let me know]({{ author.twitterUrl }})!
