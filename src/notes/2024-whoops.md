Hello strangers. It's been four years since I [started this site](/articles/finally-a-new-site/). Each year I've done a Year in Review post on the anniversary of the site launch in September. I missed that milestone this year and will attempt to make up for it now. 

This year's Year in Review, or "Year four in the books" as it would've been named, will be very short. Ready? Nothing happened. At least here at the this site.

Elsewhere in life [plenty happened](https://danabyerly-junkdrawer.website/blog/in-case-you-were-wondering/). And while things were going not great in my personal life, things were also much busier in my work life, although with some notable bright spots. Basically my attention has been elsewhere, and that will probably continue for the time being.

Back to the matter at hand, in my usual [Year in review post](/tag/year-in-review/) I note whatever I've done and things that I want to accomplish the next year. [Last year](/notes/year-three-in-the-books/) I was pleased with my progress. This year, [not so much](/notes/year-three-in-the-books/#whats-next)...

* Tinkering? Nope.
* Rearchitecting CSS? Nope.
* Reworking the homepage? Nope.
* Hedging? Should've done more of that.

What, if anything, did I manage to do?

* The [only thing I did around here](/changelog/2024-03-23/) was add update my ineffectual robots.txt to keep with bad doers and clean up some link rot introduced by Google's Web Dev redesign.
* I did [revamp the TV Blurbs](https://danabyerly-junkdrawer.website/blog/blurb-tidying/) sections at the Junk Drawer.
* I also managed to launch a new site!

Yes, even in a year where I could barely do anything other than keep my head above water I launched a site, and promptly forgot to mention it here or on Mastodon. The site is an archive of a pet blog I wrote between 2006-2007 called [Home Zoo](https://www.homezoo.org/).

It was sitting around gathering dust on a very old version of WordPress, so I moved it to Eleventy. It only has about 20 or so posts so it was easy to convert. And I find doing that kind of work oddly relaxing. 

I kept the design similar to the original site. The gigantic poor quality header image is the original image used on the old WordPress site, but set to the take the full width of the screen so it looks extra bad on big screens. That was the intended outcome.

The sidebars use the design of the old version and the color palette is roughly the same, now with better contrast. At any rate, if you'd like to read some not interesting posts from an almost 20 year old pet blog, please [visit the Home Zoo](https://www.homezoo.org/)!

As for next year? Not holding my breath, but I will be posting my 2024 Defaults post here tomorrow. And I'm planning to do my annual [Junk Drawer Wake Up Song](https://danabyerly-junkdrawer.website/wake-up-songs/) recap ([2023](https://danabyerly-junkdrawer.website/blog/wake-up-songs-2023/)) and one sentence about everything I watched in 2024 post ([2022](https://danabyerly-junkdrawer.website/blog/what-i-watched-in-2022/), [2023](https://danabyerly-junkdrawer.website/blog/what-i-watched-in-2023/)). Fingers crossed.
