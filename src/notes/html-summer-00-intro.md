Nothing says summer like sitting in a cool, shaded room while writing some HTML.

Last fall when Estelle Weyl's [Learn HTML course](https://web.dev/learn/html/) was [announced at Google's web.dev](https://web.dev/introducing-learn-html/) I took a quick look and made a mental note to come back to it. 

> If you've been building websites for years, this course may fill in gaps in knowledge that you didn't even know you had.

The content I'm here for! Despite writing HTML for over 25 years I have no doubt there are plenty of things I don't know.

Part of the reason I started this site was to have a place to write about things I'm working on or learning. It's been both fun and helpful. There's always something to learn, even in areas where I'm the most comfortable and familiar. 

With that in mind I'm going write a post for each section of [Learn HTML](https://web.dev/learn/html/), 20 in all. I'll note things I didn't know, highlight interesting items and generally enjoy having a Hot HTML Summer. I've already written the first five as a test to see if the series would be worthy blog fodder. I'll let you be the judge of that! 

I don't have a time frame other than "summer". I'll publish the first five over the coming days, one per day, and then the rest as I complete them. Who knows, I might even find an idea for this year's [HTMHell Advent calendar](https://mastodon.social/@matuzo@front-end.social/110537092117831699)! Happy Hot HTML Summering.
