summary: 'Snazzing up the type and some housekeeping.'

In an effort to make the site a little less dull I switched the body font from the system font stack to Bitter, which I was already using for headings. I did leave the system font stack on some meta info, such as tags.

Other clean up includes...

* Fine tuned content padding.
* Added a bit of x padding for content at smaller sizes.
* Added fallbacks for <code>clamp()</code>.
* Added <code>text-underline-offset</code> to links.
* Changed blockquote background color from to a slightly darker option the color palette.
* Increased space between primary navigation links when wrapped.
