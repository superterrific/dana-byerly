summary: 'A grab bag of tweaks.'
---

* Added a shortcode for using ```cite``` in a blockquote.
* Added CSS in ```content.css``` so that ```cite``` is not italic.
* Some text tweaks.
* Tweak for font caching (hope it works!).
* Added ```role="list"``` to all lists where ```list-style: none``` (via [HTML Recipes](https://htmlrecipes.dev/#navigation-links)).
