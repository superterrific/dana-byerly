summary: 'A lot content style updates'
---

Did a whole lotta clean up of content styles.

* Wrapped  date stamps in ```p``` to improve spacing within in [Articles](/articles/) and [Notes](/notes/).
* Removed redundant ```font-size``` style in ```content.css``` for reading styles.
* Changed markdown files to use markdown for ```<code>``` instead of the html tag.
* Tightened up ```li``` margin.
* Added ```hr``` style.
* Tweaked ```.reading``` font size.
* Added image width to ```projects.json``` and ```project-summary.html``` partial to (hopefully!) help with CLS on homepage.
* Added ```clamp``` to figure padding.
* Removed ```.full-bleed``` from homepage hero and added negative x-margin to ```.hp-hero``` in hopes of reducing CLS.
* Added ```min-height``` to ```.pad-hero``` in hopes of reducing CLS.
