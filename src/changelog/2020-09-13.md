## Image optimization
I converted the [Projects section](/projects/) images to next-generation formats, [details here](/notes/fun-with-image-optimization).

## Converted the changelog to a collection
This is somewhat of an experiment in that the intention is not to treat the changelog like a blog where each entry has an individual page. The intention is to get the benefit of pagination instead of a single, long scrolling screen (since apparently I'm going to write verbose changelogs that are pretty much only for me, but out here in the open instead of in [Notion]({{ tools.notion }}) like usual). We'll see how this works out after I get few in here.

## Other
* Adjusted the spacing in the footer when the columns wrap.
* Adding some spacing styles for <code>ol</code> that were there for <code>ul</code>.
* Simplified tag partials used on Articles and Notes.
* Slight tweak to SyntaxHighlighter plugin CSS theme changing the yellow to orange.
