* Yikes, only the second changelog of 2024!.
* Added Zach Leathman's [Snow Fall Web Component](https://www.zachleat.com/web/snow-fall/) to the homepage. 
* I've been getting some [odd bot traffic](https://mastodon.social/@superterrific/113651950667416173), so I've temporarily installed [Microsoft Clarity](https://clarity.microsoft.com/) to see if the bot traffic is getting through on Clarity.
* Cleaned up a few [Hot HTML Summer](/tag/hot-html-summer/) link framents that missed [last time](/changelog/2024-03-23/).
