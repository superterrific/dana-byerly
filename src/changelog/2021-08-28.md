summary: 'Added a Manifest.'

* I noticed that my RSS listing in [Feedly]({{ tools.feedly }}) didn't include my favicon. I suspect this is because I'm using a SVG for a favicon, but I added a manifest.json file to see if it would pick up an icon from there. And as a bonus if anyone every decides to add the site to their home screen it will look a little nicer. I'll probably come back and make the favicon a png if this doesn't work.
