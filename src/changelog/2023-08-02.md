Instead of making an individual changelog for each change I made along the way I've collected them here.

* Added `rel="prev"` and `rel="next"` to post-level and listing-level pagination.
* Removed Twitter specific meta tags, not related to Hot HTML Summer.
* Removed web monetization meta tag, although I thought I already did that? Also not related to Hot HTML Summer.
* Adding flow styling to `blockquotes` for better formatting when there are multiple paragraphs.
* Changed the "caption" shortcode to use a `<p>` instead of a `<div>`.
* Updated the feed layout to list the [Hot HTML Summer tag](/tag/hot-html-summer/) in chronological order.
* Added `scrollbar-gutter: stable;` to stop the jump between pages with and without scrollbar.
* Updated open graph meta tags to only use the post or page name for title, was noticing that appending the site name looked a little silly in Mastodon's unfortunately large social cards.
* Reworked front matter for the [Changelog](/changelog/) to include "Changelog: yyyy-mm-dd" in the page title and open graph title. The permalink still uses /changelog/yyyy-mm-dd
