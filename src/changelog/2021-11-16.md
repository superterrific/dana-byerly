* Fixed a heading spacing issue introduced by the [anchor update](/changelog/2021-11-01/).
* Also added "Changelog" to page titles.
* Added a "no-wrap" paired shortcode to use with attribution in blockquotes to make sure the m-dash and attribution don't wrap.
* Also added a ```.no-wrap``` class selector.
