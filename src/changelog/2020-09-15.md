Mostly a bunch of tweaks.
* Finally got font pre-loading right.
* Removed the 500 size from font stack as it wasn't being used.
* Slightly lightened the border on <code>code</code>.
* Slightly darkened the background of SyntaxHighlighter code blocks. Axe and Lighthouse throw erroneous contrast because they're using the page background instead of the parent <code>pre</code> background. Arc and Wave get it right. Either way, discovered that some of the combos weren't AAA compliant so I fixed that.
* Removed Horse Racing Datasets as a "Featured Project" from the homepage.
* Resized the remaining ill-sized images.
* Added next-gen formats for the hero image on the homepage.
* Resized the remaining project images.
* Pretty sure I'm going to rename this section Changeblog and just own the fact that most of my writing is going to be about little tweaks.
