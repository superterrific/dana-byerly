Finally updated the [Projects landing page](/projects/)!

* Removed all old images and projects.json that was populating the landing page (don't ask).
* Reworked the layout to use a more simplified grid and card approach based on some examples at [SmolCSS](https://smolcss.dev/).
* Tidied up the structure of a few landing pages and removed some partials.
* Used a combination of a [limit filter](https://11ty.rocks/eleventyjs/data-arrays/#limit-filter) and a [slice array method](https://discord.com/channels/741017160297611315/1127263495864451123/1127263495864451123) (link via 11ty Discord, you probably have join to view) to ensure that the first two images on the project page don't lazy load.
