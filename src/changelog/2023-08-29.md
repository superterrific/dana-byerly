Finally updated the [Projects landing page](/projects/)!

* Removed all old images and projects.json that was populating the landing page (don't ask).
* Reworked the layout to use a more simplified grid and card approach based on some examples at [SmolCSS](https://smolcss.dev/).
* Tidied up the structure of a few landing pages and removed some partials.
