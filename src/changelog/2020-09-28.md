summary: 'Restructured the content layouts to better share the styles across content sections.'

Restructured the content layouts to only include the content-specific styles in one place. The "Setting CSS paths in the individual layouts" section in [this article](/articles/manually-splitting-css-files-in-eleventy/) covers it, and even includes a diagram!

### Other
* Added content-visibility: auto to landing cards for projects.
* Fixed post listing to conditionally include "Filed in" based on front-matter.
* Fixed a typo in site.json.
* Fixed issue where Tag listings weren't displaying in reverse chronological order.
