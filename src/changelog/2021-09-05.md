summary: 'One more homepage tweak.'

* Fixed the spacing at the bottom of ```main``` on the homepage. When I [updated the Featured Projects section](/changelog/2021-09-03/) to use ```grid-container-sm``` I forgot to update some other instances of the updated class selector.
* Updated the Changelog landing page to show more posts per page.
* Updated the screenshot of the new homepage in the [Note about the homepage update](/notes/the-sprucing-party-continues/).
