* Added caching for images to netlify.toml.
* Removed a few organizational tags ("all", "writing", etc.) from listing on the [All Tags](/all-tags/) page.
* Fixed a whoopsie where I forgot to add the font styles to the [contact page](/contact/), which was fine because it just used system fonts, but it's fixed now.
* Moved [contact](/contact/) into the primary navigation and removed a few links from the footer.
* Made a new template for the 404 page. It was using the page template that had IndieWeb microformat markup, which didn't make sense for a 404 page.
