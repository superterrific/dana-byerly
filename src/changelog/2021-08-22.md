summary: 'New footer!'
---

* Reworked the footer to use fewer icons and layout a little better, particularly at smaller sizes.
* Removed [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/danabyerly) and [Instagram](http://instagram.com/superterrific) links, might add them back later if I start posting again.
* Updated the [colophon](/colophon/) to reflect current font usage.
* Fixed Colophon spelling.
* Removed "Back to Top" link, have added an item to my to-do list to add it within ```main``` in content areas.
