Just a few small things...

* Changed tag links on [All Tags](/tags-all/) listing page listing to use <code>slug</code>.
* Changed the individual tag listing pages title from "Tag Archive" to include the tag, e.g., [Tagged "Data" - Dana Byerly](/tag/data/).
* Added links to the [data table article](/articles/responsive-and-accessible-data-tables/) in the [Omnisurface Stars project page]({{ projectPages.oss }}/).
* Fixed a few little text nits, like adding a hyphen to "to-do" and adding a period to the of the summary of several Changelog posts.
