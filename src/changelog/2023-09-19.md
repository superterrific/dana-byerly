* Did a fair amount of file renaming to make it easier to for me to find the file of a post. I used front matter to set the title and url so the file name can be whatever, I haven't done a good job of matching the file name and the title, need to work on this a little more.
* Hopefully fixed a open graph metatag bug I introduced with the last round of updates.
