* Got rid of the Featured Projects specific grid container class selector and used existing ```grid-container-sm```, this also ensures alignment with the Recent Articles sections on the homepage.
* Change ```grid-container-sm``` min to 16rem to ensure the cards fit on smaller viewports.
* Moved the social image back to the root of the ```/img/``` directory, moving it broke the image display in existing Twitter cards.
