summary: 'Cutting down on requests'

* Changed the homepage and project landing specific CSS files to be minified on the homepage only, cutting down on requests.
* Combined the project landing and project page CSS into one file for the [Projects](/projects/) section.
* Keeping fingers crossed that this will push the homepage over into a consistent 100 performance score for Lighthouse.
