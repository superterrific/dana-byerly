summary: 'Dates updates!'

* Updated from Moment to [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/).
* Updated to the latest version of the [Eleventy RSS plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/rss/). Have noticed the the publish date for RSS is a day off, hoping this update fixes it.
* Removed the line-height from <code>blockquote</code>, it now uses the global line-height.
* Removed <code>content-visibility: auto</code> from the footer.
* Adjusted spacing within the <code>figure</code> to better handle when there is no caption with the image. Actually did this on 2021-04-02 but didn't feel like making a whole new changelog post for one little tweak.
