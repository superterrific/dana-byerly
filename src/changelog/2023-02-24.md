* Upgraded to [Eleventy v2.0.0](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v2/)
* Uninstalled browser-sync
* Added a .nvmrc file because the build was failing at Netlify with the error `Eleventy requires Node 14. You will need to upgrade Node to use Eleventy!`. I think it might have something to do with how the [environment variable](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/environment-vars/) in my production script, but some of my other sites use the same production command and didn't have the node version issue. I'm also not specifying the node version in `netlify.toml`, so I'll have to poke around to figure this out. In the meantime the file should work.
* Update: after a couple of days of wrangling I figured it out. It was cached dependencies from a depracated build image at Netlify, [details here](/notes/upgrading-to-eleventy-2-0-0/#failed-builds-at-netlify).
