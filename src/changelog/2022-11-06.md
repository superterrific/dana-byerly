summary: 'Adding studio links and other tweaks.'
---

* Changed the "Featured Projects" section of the homepage to be "From the Studio". Used the same cards, but linked externally to two client projects.
* Changed the background color for the "Featured" homepage cards in dark mode.
* Also changed the background color for tags in dark mode.
* Both new colors are new variations of `--color-primary`, which seems like I've taken it too far. But that's what redesigns are for... someday!
* Removed "Published on" from article summary date stamp.
* Moved "Filed in" under the date stamp (only appears on the homepage and tag pages). Feels like it's much easier to scan now.
* Fixed incorrect categories for the two Wordpress / Eleventy eleventy posts.
