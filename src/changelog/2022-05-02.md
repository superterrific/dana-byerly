summary: 'Spring cleaning!'

Plenty of clean-up around here!

* Simplified tag code to use a single partial.
  * Was previously duplicating code in `article-summary.html` (used for listing pages) and `post-content.html` (used for individual posts) because the location in for loop call was different for each.
  * Streamlined to a single `tags.html` partial using a variable to set the location in the for loop.
  * The location is set using Nunjucks `set` in the template, allowing both instances to use the same code but different specific calls.

```html
<!-- tags.html -->
<span class="visually-hidden">A list of tags for this post.</span>
<ul class="tag-list tag-list-summary" role="list">
  {% raw %}{% for tag in tagLocation %}
    <li>
      <a href="/tag/{{ tag | slug }}/">
        <span role="presentation">#</span>{{ tag | replace(' ', '-') | lower }}
      </a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}{% endraw %}
</ul>

<!-- In article-summary.html -->
{% raw %}{% set tagLocation = item.data.tags %}{% endraw %}

<!-- In post-content.html -->
{% raw %}{% set tagLocation = tags %}{% endraw %}
```

* Reworked the homepage hero to be [less micromanage-y](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/) and over-coded.
  * Originally the layout was using a grid to set the two columns, but also had a flex fallback. In hindsight the allowed for more control but was also not really needed to get roughly the same effect which less code, and more importantly less micromanaging.
  * Removed the grid and enhanced the flex layout to be simplified yet more robust.
  * Removed some of the pixel-futzing code and used existing utilities (e.g., `.full-bleed`).
  * Drastically reduced use of media queries for things that could be handled with `clamp()` and other more resilient approaches.
  * Did keep one media query (resizing the image) and added a new one (centering the text) because I couldn't figure out how to handle them otherwise, but I'm OK with that for now.
* Other stuff...
  * Did a bit of clean-up in Projects, removing the need for class-selectors in the hero.
  * A variety of little template tweaks to support some of the CSS changes.
  * Added `clamp()` to the menu `font-size` to make better use of space on smaller screens. Tricky to balance good space with tap target sizing, legibility and layout. Think the update manages all the concerns across the wide variety of device and screensize, at least it looks that way [using Sizzy]({{ tools.sizzy }})!

Hoping to continue with some rearchitecting and code clean-up without succumbing to a full-on redesign. Wish me luck!
