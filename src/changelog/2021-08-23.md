summary: 'Added a Style Guide!'
---

* Added a minimal [Style Guide](/style-guide). Just did it with an existing template and markdown but might comeback and create a specific template so I can more easily illustrate state-specific things, like the style used for selected text.
* Worked on the footer a bit more, moving all the links to their own row and setting it to ```flex-direction: column``` at 800px and below.
* Added [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/danabyerly) back. Hopefully this will prompt me to add some photos I've been meaning to add!
* Removed ```position: relative``` from the main and content wrapper.
