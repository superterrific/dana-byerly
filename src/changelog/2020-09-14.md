## Image swap
I recompressed some of the images that looked a little too compressed in hindsight. Most of them I just recompressed a bit less aggressively, but I picked a new image for the Random Replay Generator landing page. It compressed better and it's from the 1904 Brooklyn Handicap, which is kind of mind boggling!

I also ended up resizing some of the images, which helped with image file size and performance. I'm going to come back and resize the remaining ones later in the week.

## Other
* Changed fonts to preload, hoping that will push my homepage Lighthouse performance score from 99 to 100.
* It didn't, but resizing the image of me my doggy did (it was the largest contentful paint). [I'm currently at all 100s](https://twitter.com/superterrific/status/1305686921881047040).
