summary: 'Image swap and font preload.'

### Image swap
I changed some of the images that looked a little too compressed in hindsight. The Random Replay Generator, Horse Racing Datasets and Paths to the Derby landing page images as well as one of the content images for Horse Racing Datasets and Paths to the Derby. Most of them I just recompressed a bit less aggressively, but I picked a new image for the Random Replay Generator landing page. It compressed better and it's from the 1904 Brooklyn Handicap, which is kind of mind boggling!

### Other
* Changed fonts to preload, hoping that will push my homepage Lighthouse performance score from 99 to 100.
