## Anchors
Added anchors to <code>h3</code> using a logical OR, but the anchor is also applied applied to <code>h4</code> - <code>h6</code>. This is fine but I don't know why it's happening.

In <code>/utils/markdown-anchor</code> I added <code>h3</code> via a logical OR, originally it was only <code>h2</code>...

```js
if (tokens[index].tag === 'h2' || 'h3') {
  return `<${
    tokens[index].tag
  } id="${slug}">`;
}
return `<${tokens[index].tag}>`;
};
```

And closing the tag...

```js
if (tokens[index].tag === 'h2' || 'h3') {
  return ` <a class="${
    options.anchorClass
  }" href="#${slug}">
  <span class="visually-hidden">permalink</span>
  <span aria-hidden="true">#</span>
  </a></${tokens[index].tag}>`;
}
return `</${tokens[index].tag}>`;
};
```

Here it is in action...

## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
#### Heading level 4
##### Heading level 5
###### Heading level 6

Just when I was feeling proud of figuring out how to add <code>h3</code> and thought maybe I was starting to understand JavaScript!

## Styles for headling level 4
* Going to be using a good old <code>h4</code> in an upcoming post and added spacing styles (and inadvertently anchors ðŸ˜‚).
