summary: 'Accessibility fixes.'

* Updated studio cards on the homepage to have better focus and hover states in Windows High Contrast Mode.
* Removed the "home" link from the site title.
* Updated the Accessibility Statement to reflect some recent additional testing.
* Added a conditional "Last updated on" display, primarily to use on the [Accessibility Statement](/accessibility-statement/). At some point I may want to make it its own element, now the publish date element is doing double duty because I don't use publish dates on pages.
* Also added a `rel` link to Mastodon in the `head` of the base template a few days to make the link to this site "verified".
* Updated the alternative text for the Rhonda Lieberman site studio card on the homepage to fix some unnecessary verbosity.
