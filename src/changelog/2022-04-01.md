summary: 'Link rot cleanup and other housekeeping'
---

* Cleaned up link rot and link errors found using [Dr Link Check](https://www.drlinkcheck.com/), but left a few dead links in the [archived version of the site](/archive/01), might eventually come back and clean those up.
* Removed [RSS to syndicate to Dev.to](/changelog/2021-11-28/#syndicating-specific-posts), I might add it back if start to post more things that would be good there.
