summary: 'Added heading anchors and table styles.'
---

A few new items...

* Added markdown-it-anchor to add anchors to headings within posts with help from [this](https://11ty.rocks/eleventyjs/slugs-anchors/) and [this](https://github.com/valeriangalliat/markdown-it-anchor).

* Added <code>scroll-margin-top</code> to all <code>h2</code> within articles and notes.

* Want to figure out how to add a visually hidden span before the permalink to announce the link, as well as use an inline svg for the permalink before enabling permalink. Left the settings there in the config file for now. There's an example of how to do it [in Hylia](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/hylia/blob/master/src/transforms/parse-transform.js).

* Added table styles for [comparison table in Airtable post](/articles/using-airtable-with-eleventy/#collections-versus-remote-data-comparison), doesn't include sticky header in <code>th</code>, will need to add that in the future if needed, probably as it's own th class (e.g., <code>th class="sticky"</code>).
