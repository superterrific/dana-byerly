I finally figured out how to fix the [if statetment Frankenstein I created](/changelog/2020-09-21/) for minifying and splitting CSS by taking the "set css" variable out of the base template and moving it to content specific templates, calling only the CSS files needed for each content type. I'll write a post about it rather than documenting it here.

## Other
* Added <code>content-visibility: auto;</code> to the footer. Am going to figure out where else I can add it.
