summary: 'Moved the &apos;set css&apos; variable from the base template into content-specific templates.'
---

I finally figured out how to fix the [if statetment Frankenstein I created](/changelog/2020-09-21/) for minifying and splitting CSS by taking the "set css" variable out of the base template and moving it to content specific templates, calling only the CSS files needed for each content type. I'll write a post about it rather than documenting it here.

### Other
* Added <code>content-visibility: auto;</code> to the footer. Am going to figure out where else I can add it.
* Removed font pre-loading, kept getting a console warning that the fonts were preloaded but not used. Might look into it more and add preloading back if I can figure out the issue.
