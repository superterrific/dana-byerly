Caught a few things when writing the [article on responsive and accessible tables](/articles/responsive-and-accessible-data-tables/) for [Omnisurface Stars]({{ projectPages.oss }}).

* Added an aria-label to primary navigation.
* Added visually hidden text to announce "A list of tags for this post" for tags on listing pages ([Articles](/articles/), [Notes](/notes/), [Homepage](/)).
* Added Sizzy to tools.json.
* Adjusted styles for <code>ol</code> and <code>ul</code> in content.css to fine tune spacing and line-height.
* Switched the mobile image on OSS project page to be static instead of animated.
* Updated project pages to use <code>section</code> and <code>h2</code> for the meta data in the hero section.
