Clean up from the [Hot HTML Summer to do list](/notes/hot-html-summer-wrap-up/#the-hot-html-summer-to-do-list) plus a bonus update.

* Added `rel="next"` and `rel="prev"` to Project section pagination.
* Changed instances of `<section>` where there was not a heading level to `<div>`. Interestingly found some correct usages on Project pages. Go me!
* Added `<nav>` to the links in the footer.
* Added robots.txt to [block ChatGPT](https://ruby.social/@olivierlacan/110846882340835196).
