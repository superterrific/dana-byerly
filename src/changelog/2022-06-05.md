* Added [Eleventy]({{ tools.11ty }}) as the generator within the `meta` tags.
* Added the `meta` for IE compatibility back ([removed it here](/changelog/2021-11-28/#grab-bag)).
* Renamed some files to be inline with naming conventions I've standardized on elsewhere.
* Fixed a bug where images within a `figure` that were smaller than the available size were not centered. I can't figure out when I introduced that bug, whoops!
* Minor clarification about image use in the [Style Guide](/style-guide/)
