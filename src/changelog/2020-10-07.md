summary: 'Tweak to headingLevel variable plus a few others.'
---

Just a few small tweaks...

* Switched 'headingLevel' variable to default to h2 unless specified, previously it was set to default to h3 but h3 is the edge case.
* Tweaked homepage intro copy to include my name.
* Added content-visibility: auto to <code>figure</code>.
